Dataset: 2011-2016 H1B VISA applications (1,048,576 rows, 42 columns)
The H1B visa allows U.S. companies to employ foreign talent, but its application process, controlled by the U.S. Department of Labour, 
is both lengthy and expensive. Employers must sponsor these visas, while employees face uncertainty as sponsorships can be withdrawn at any time. 
Our H1B application data, including both approved and denied cases, will be used for predictive analysis, 
aiming to provide insights on the likelihood of certification. In addition, we intend to explore related socio-economic issues.
